# Tic-TacToe_with_MiniMax
A self-programmed Tic Tac Toe game

This Project is part of the Odin Project to deepen the concept of Factory Functions and Code Organisation 

I specifically choosed to porgamm Player vs AI with different Difficulty settings. 

Depending on the selected difficulty the probability of the next Move to be based on MiniMax-Algorithm is increased.

MiniMax-Algorithm is used in Game Theory at which a two Player round-based Game is provided.
