# Tic-TacToe Game with Mini-Max Algorithm

I present you my version of a Tic-Tac-Toe game. A roundbased Player vs Computer game. The user can choose the difficulty before each game. The difficulty is a ratio between a Mini-Max algorythm and a random move. At the highest difficulty the Mini-Max algorythm operates at each step which makes the Computer unbeatable. 

This project shall deepen the concept of Factory Functions as well as Code Organisation 

MiniMax-Algorithm is used in Game Theory at which a two Player round-based Game is provided.
